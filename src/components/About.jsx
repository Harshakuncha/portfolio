          Iâ€™m a passionate Software Engineer with over 3 years of experience building scalable backend systems, intuitive frontends,
          and cloud-native applications across fintech, enterprise, and AI-driven domains. I bring deep expertise in Java, Node.js,
          React, and Python, with hands-on experience designing microservice architectures, optimizing distributed systems, and
          deploying production-grade applications on AWS.

          My journey spans leading organizations like Oracle and Samsung, where I delivered high-throughput payment platforms,
          resilient infrastructure, and AI-enhanced microservices. I'm currently pursuing my Master's in Computer Science at Arizona
          State University (CGPA: 4.0), thriving at the intersection of systems engineering and innovation. I love tackling complex
          real-world problems through clean, efficient code and thoughtful design.
