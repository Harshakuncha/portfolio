        About Me
      </h2>

      <p style={{ lineHeight: '1.7', fontSize: '1.1rem', color: '#444' }}>
        Iâ€™m a passionate Software Engineer with 3+ years of experience building scalable, data-driven web applications and backend systems. I specialize in full-stack development using modern technologies like Python, FastAPI, React, Node.js, and Spring Boot. My work has spanned across fintech, cloud-native platforms, and performance-critical systems, with a proven ability to design RESTful APIs, implement service-oriented architectures, and optimize end-to-end performance.

        At Growealth, I engineered real-time dashboards and dispute-resolution APIs that surfaced $3.2M+ in savings and reduced latency by 40%. Prior to that, I contributed to high-availability microservices at Oracle and developed 5G simulation tools during my internship at Samsung. I enjoy writing clean, testable code and thrive in collaborative environments that challenge me to learn, iterate, and build systems that scale.
