        About Me
      </h2>

      <p style={{ lineHeight: '1.7', fontSize: '1.1rem', color: '#444' }}>
        Iâ€™m a passionate Software Engineer with 3+ years of experience building scalable backend systems, intuitive frontends, and cloud-native applications across fintech, enterprise, and AI-driven domains. I bring deep expertise in Java, Node.js, React, and Python, with hands-on experience in designing microservices architectures, optimizing distributed systems, and deploying production-grade applications on AWS. My journey spans across leading firms like Oracle and Samsung, where I delivered high-throughput payment platforms and resilient infrastructure solutions. Currently pursuing my Master's in Computer Science at Arizona State University (CGPA: 4.0), I thrive at the intersection of systems engineering and innovation, with a strong drive to solve complex real-world problems through clean, efficient code and thoughtful design.

        At Growealth, I engineered real-time dashboards and dispute-resolution APIs that surfaced $3.2M+ in savings and reduced latency by 40%. Prior to that, I contributed to high-availability microservices at Oracle and developed 5G simulation tools during my internship at Samsung. I enjoy writing clean, testable code and thrive in collaborative environments that challenge me to learn, iterate, and build systems that scale.
